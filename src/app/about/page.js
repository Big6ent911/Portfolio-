          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            Hi! I’m Daniel, a passionate web developer. I specialize in creating beautiful and functional web applications. My journey began in high school, fueled by curiosity about how websites work. I started with HTML and CSS, gradually expanding my skills.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            Currently, I work at SaintX, crafting innovative solutions for clients. I focus on building responsive and user-friendly applications. I believe great design enhances user experience and engagement. Collaboration is essential; I enjoy working with designers and fellow developers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code. Continuous learning is a core value of mine. I regularly explore new technologies and trends in the industry. I also contribute to open-source projects, finding it rewarding to give back.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            When I’m not coding, I love outdoor activities. Photography is another passion of mine, allowing me to capture moments creatively. I enjoy attending tech meetups to network and learn from others. Sharing knowledge with fellow developers inspires me.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
            I’m excited about the future of web development and all the opportunities it presents. If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out. Let’s create something amazing together!
